# Introduction

This is a [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) static webpage that I was creating and threw in some irrelevant content instead of using filler text. Digital marketing as many of you might already know is all about user friendliness, speed, decluttering your website, [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), [SMM](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-social-media-marketing) etc. Many websites are been viewed from mobile apps and many people are no longer patient with  slow platforms which have overwhelming content.

A user who is listening to music on his phone in a bus and is also receiving texts via whatsapp and e-mails doesn't have time to read all the content you have put there unless you are blogging. If you use analytics to track your visitors, then you might realise that 90% of who visit never get past your homepage. 

Too much color should also be avoided as it irritates the eye, but you can use it sometimes to entice people to order stuff, especially in the food industry. (I have made a static single page with vivid colors to demonstrate this). If people are searching for the nearest restaurant it's because they are hungry and one would go where the food seems to be palatable. 

I won't go in depth about static websites as I seldom design them, but I reckon that if you are reading this you do follow marketing webinars and you are aware of the current trends, technological shifts, pitfalls, optimizing AdSence and best options to earn from your content eg PPC, CPC & CPM ads.


# What the webpage should do 

There isn't much logic involved here, just simple coding without the fear of plunging yourself into the forest gump of human misery. Around 40 minutes to one hour and everything is set-up because the web page won't do anything beyond it's intended purpose. This kind of single pages, (not to confuse with  [SPAs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx) are intended for is marketing a place, a business or some [papayas](http://www.hawaiipapaya.com/) if it's set-up in Hawaii. 


# Technologies 


## HTML5
[HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used to format content for it to be readable on a browser. Browsers display such content and examples include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE etc; such content is fetched and displayed via a URL/URI. 

The HTTP protocol ensures data communication within the internet. It supports POST(accept and store data), GET(data retrieval) among other requests like HEAD, DESTROY/DELETE, PATCH etc which form the foundations of RESTful architecture. 

Information on webpages is reinforced by the HTML Semantics which ensure a compatibility between new and old browsers. Complex web API's are well supported and it's "buoyancy" in disposition has seen it embrace new technologies like SVG, Video Streaming, Audio, as well as the adoption of new syntaxes. 


## CSS3
[CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3). It's a style language which is used to style documentation written in HTML. This tech is not only used in HTML but extends to XML, SVG and XUL. 

CSS is very versatile in that it can be used to style inline HTML as well as being rendered from outside through SoC. Many stylesheets can be linked to the main HTML page enhancing collaboration and code readability.
